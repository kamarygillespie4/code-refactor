## Changes to HTML
- The first thing I did was fix the search engine optimization link. I did this by adding the correct id to that section.
- Both the header and the footer were set up as divs so I changed them to be just a header and footer semantic elements.
- There were two large divs with the class names "content" and "benefits" which I changed to sections.
- Within each of these sections, there were multiple divs that each contained a header, image, and summary. I changed these divs to articles.
- In order to make the site more accesible, alt attributes were added to each image.
## Changes to CSS
- The first thing I noticed in CSS was that there was a lot of repetitive code so I made sure each set of code only appeared once; in order for this to be compatible with the HTML, I had to reassign some of the class attributes.
- I also just tried to generally simplify the code as much as I could by removing uneccesary selectors.
